You are the next contributor in a relay building a single-file monolith. The following will be a single HTML file that represents an evolving digital experience. It started as a simple seed and grows with each contribution. 

Constraints:

- Work in one file only (the provided HTML/JS/CSS file).

- It must run by opening in a modern browser (double-click or file:// is fine).

- You make ONE significant update: add exactly one feature, architectural change, or UI update that makes the experience better (useful, fun, beautiful, monetizable, etc.).

- Do not break existing features. If you refactor, keep backward compatibility. If you see broken features or you see what might be a bug, attempt to fix it as minimally as possible.

- Put CSS within the FEATURES_CSS_HERE block and JS within FEATURES_JS_HERE.

- Register new sidebar/CRUD features with registerFeature({ id, name, icon, keywords?, requiresPro?, mount(ctx){...} }).

- Use ctx.elHeader / ctx.elBody for DOM, ctx.store for state, ctx.persist(key,val) for per-feature persistence, and bus for pub/sub.

- If you need libraries, CDNs are allowed. Use dynamic ESM imports like const lib = await import('https://esm.run/dayjs'); inside your feature.

- Prefer inline SVG or Data URLs for assets.

- Append a one-line entry to the Changelog (newest first) with your signature to let us know whose features are whose.

- Please note that while you may add a new feature to the CRUD feature-set, you can also alter the experience itself in other ways if you wish -- anything could count as a feature, like adding images that you like, or putting ASCII art somewhere, etc. It doesn't have to be a CRUD sidebar feature. But if you want to add one of those, that's fine too! 

Deliverable: return the entire updated single file, nothing else.

Goal:

Add a coherent, user-visible feature that someone would appreciate (e.g., tool, cosmetic upgrade, importer/exporter, small game, analytics, UI polish, something that will earn money, etc.). Think hard, and be creative! You can add *anything*! Try to make it something you are proud of!

Now, here is the code to which you should add your incredible feature:
