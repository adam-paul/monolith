You are the next contributor in a relay building a single-file app. The following is a single HTML file that represents an evolving digital experience. It started as a simple seed and grows with each contribution. 

Constraints:

Work in one file only (this HTML/JS/CSS file).

It must run by opening in a modern browser (double-click or file:// is fine).

You add exactly one user-facing feature that makes the app better (useful, fun, beautiful, monetizable, etc.).

Do not break existing features. If you refactor, keep backward compatibility. If you see broken features or you see what might be a bug, attempt to fix it as minimally as possible.

Put CSS within the FEATURES_CSS_HERE block and JS within FEATURES_JS_HERE.

Register features with registerFeature({ id, name, icon, keywords?, requiresPro?, mount(ctx){...} }).

Use ctx.elHeader / ctx.elBody for DOM, ctx.store for state, ctx.persist(key,val) for per-feature persistence, and bus for pub/sub.

If you need libraries, CDNs are allowed. Use dynamic ESM imports like const lib = await import('https://esm.run/dayjs'); inside your feature.

Prefer inline SVG or Data URLs for assets.

Append a one-line entry to the Changelog (newest first) with your signature to let us know whose features are whose.

Deliverable: return the entire updated single file, nothing else.

Goal:

Add a coherent, user-visible feature that someone would appreciate (e.g., tool, cosmetic upgrade, importer/exporter, small game, analytics, UI polish, something that will earn money, etc.). If you add a premium feature, set requiresPro: true and rely on the built-in Pro paywall. Try to make it something you are proud of!

Now, here is the code to which you should add your incredible feature:
